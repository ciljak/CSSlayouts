<!DOCTYPE html>
<!--
By default, that box will be just big enough to contain the element itself. In the image below, I've added a background color to different 
HTML elements so you can see the boxes that contain each element.

Why do the boxes behave differently depending on the element type? Some of the elements are block-level elements and some are inline elements. 
Block-level elements span the entire width of their containing element, whereas inline elements are only wide enough for their contents.
